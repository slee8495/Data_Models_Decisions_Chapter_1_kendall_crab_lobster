## Introduction

Kendall Crab and Lobster, Inc. (KCL), a leading seafood delivery company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, specializes in the overnight delivery of live lobsters to customers across the Northeastern United States. As the Director of Overnight Delivery Operations, **Jeff Daniels** is responsible for ensuring the smooth flow of deliveries, which is critical to KCL’s profitability and reputation.

One day, Jeff faces a pressing operational dilemma: a **fall storm** is rapidly approaching Boston with a **50% chance** of shutting down **Logan International Airport** around **5 PM**. Historically, storms of this magnitude have led to immediate airport closures, causing major disruptions to KCL’s delivery operations. With only a few hours to decide, Jeff must determine the best course of action to minimize financial losses and maintain customer satisfaction.

---

## The Problem

Jeff has **three main options** to address the potential disruption. Each option has unique **cost implications, operational risks, and probabilities** associated with the storm’s impact.

### Option 1: Wait and See

- **Description:**  
  Jeff could **wait until 5 PM** to see if the storm actually shuts down Logan Airport. If the airport remains open, KCL can proceed with its **normal overnight air delivery** through United Express, maintaining standard operations without additional costs.
  
  However, if the storm **forces Logan to close**, Jeff would then face two sub-options:
  1. **Cancel Orders:** Refund customers, issue **$20 discount coupons** for future purchases. This results in a **$10 per lobster** loss in profit.
  2. **Last-Minute Reroute via MAF:** Contact **Massachusetts Air Freight (MAF)** to truck the lobsters to Worcester, MA, and fly them from there. This last-minute arrangement costs **$19 per lobster**.

- **Probabilities & Costs:**
  - **50% chance** Logan remains open → **No additional cost**.  
  - **50% chance** Logan closes:
    - **Cancel Orders:** **$10 loss per lobster**.  
    - **Use MAF last-minute:** **$19 additional cost per lobster**.


---

### Option 2: Preemptively Use Massachusetts Air Freight (MAF)

- **Description:**  
  Jeff could proactively arrange to use **Massachusetts Air Freight (MAF)**. MAF would **truck the lobsters to Worcester, MA** (50 miles inland), where they would be flown to United Express's sorting facility in Washington, D.C.

- **Probabilities & Costs:**
  - **Additional Cost:**  
    - **$13 per lobster** (if storm hits and Logan closes, about **67%** of MAF usage cases).
    - **$19 per lobster** (if Logan remains open and MAF was unnecessarily used, about **33%** of MAF usage cases).
  

---

### Option 3: Commit to Truck Delivery via Eastern Parcel Delivery (EPD)

- **Description:**  
  Jeff could arrange for **Eastern Parcel Delivery (EPD)**, a regional trucking company, to deliver lobsters **directly to customers**. To secure EPD’s services, Jeff must **commit by noon**, well before knowing if the storm will shut down Logan.

- **Probabilities & Costs:**
  - **Cost:**  
    - EPD’s delivery is more expensive than air freight, ranging from **$2 to $4 per lobster** above the normal cost, depending on distance.
    - Historical data shows:
      - **50% chance** of an **additional $4 per lobster**.
      - **25% chance** of an **additional $3 per lobster**.
      - **25% chance** of an **additional $2 per lobster**.

## The Goal of the Analysis

The objective is to **construct a decision tree** that visualizes Jeff Daniels’ options, their associated probabilities, and costs. This decision tree will allow Jeff to **quantitatively evaluate** each scenario and determine the **optimal strategy** that minimizes costs while maintaining reliable service.

The analysis will:
1. **Visualize** the decision-making process with clear pathways and outcomes.
2. **Incorporate probabilities and costs** to evaluate the financial impact of each option.
3. **Guide Jeff** toward a decision that balances risk and cost-effectiveness, ensuring customer satisfaction and operational continuity.

By using this structured approach, Jeff can confidently present his decision to senior management, demonstrating both **analytical rigor** and a **strategic mindset** in handling operational uncertainties.

## Expected Monetary Value (EMV) Calculation

### Option 1: Wait and See

- **Logan Stays Open (50%)**  
  Profit = **$10 per lobster**  
  Probability = **50%**

- **Logan Closes (50%)**  
  - **Cancel Orders:** Loss = **$10 per lobster** (50%)  
  - **Last-Minute MAF:** Net Loss = **$9 per lobster** (50%)

**EMV Calculation:**  
- EMV (Logan Open) = 0.5 * $10 = **$5**  
- EMV (Logan Closes) = 0.5 * [(0.5 * -$10) + (0.5 * -$9)] = 0.5 * -$9.5 = **-$4.75**  

**Total EMV (Wait and See) = $5 + (-$4.75) = $0.25 per lobster**

---

### Option 2: Preemptively Use MAF

- **Logan Closes (50%)**  
  Net Loss = **-$3 per lobster**  

- **Logan Stays Open (50%)**  
  Net Loss = **-$9 per lobster**

**EMV Calculation:**  
- EMV (Logan Closes) = 0.5 * -$3 = **-$1.5**  
- EMV (Logan Stays Open) = 0.5 * -$9 = **-$4.5**  

**Total EMV (Preemptively Use MAF) = -$1.5 + (-$4.5) = -$6 per lobster**

---

### Option 3: Commit to Truck Delivery via EPD

- **$4 Additional Cost (50%)**  
  Profit = **$6 per lobster**  

- **$3 Additional Cost (25%)**  
  Profit = **$7 per lobster**  

- **$2 Additional Cost (25%)**  
  Profit = **$8 per lobster**

**EMV Calculation:**  
- EMV ($4 Cost) = 0.5 * $6 = **$3**  
- EMV ($3 Cost) = 0.25 * $7 = **$1.75**  
- EMV ($2 Cost) = 0.25 * $8 = **$2**  

**Total EMV (Commit to EPD) = $3 + $1.75 + $2 = $6.75 per lobster**

---

## Summary of EMVs

| **Option**                    | **EMV per Lobster**  |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Wait and See**              | **$0.25**            |
| **Preemptively Use MAF**      | **-$6**              |
| **Commit to Truck Delivery**  | **$6.75**            |

---

## Conclusion

Based on the EMV calculations:

- **Commit to Truck Delivery via EPD** is the **optimal decision**, providing the highest expected profit of **$6.75 per lobster**.
- **Wait and See** is marginally profitable at **$0.25 per lobster**, but it carries higher operational risks due to uncertainty.
- **Preemptively Using MAF** results in an expected **loss of $6 per lobster**, making it the least favorable option.

Thus, Jeff should **commit to truck delivery via EPD** to maximize profitability while ensuring reliable delivery.

## Conclusion

Based on the **Expected Monetary Value (EMV)** calculations, **committing to truck delivery via Eastern Parcel Delivery (EPD)** is the **optimal decision**. Despite higher transportation costs, this option yields the highest EMV of **$6.75 per lobster**, ensuring both profitability and operational reliability.

- **Wait and See** has an EMV of **$0.25 per lobster**, indicating minimal expected gains but exposing KCL to significant risks if Logan Airport closes.
- **Preemptively Using MAF** results in a negative EMV of **-$6 per lobster**, reflecting substantial potential losses, particularly if the storm does not impact airport operations.
- **Committing to EPD** guarantees delivery regardless of weather conditions, maintaining customer satisfaction and offering a consistent profit margin, even in the most costly scenarios.

Given these insights, Jeff should proceed with **EPD truck delivery** to secure both financial stability and customer trust, demonstrating proactive and data-driven decision-making in response to operational uncertainties.
